❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum() {
  return a + b;
}
```

🔍 Issues:

- ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will likely result in an error (ReferenceError) when the
  function is executed.
- ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its reusability. It's unclear what `a` and `b` are supposed to
  be.
- ❌ Missing JSDoc comments and function description

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

- ✔️ Now the function `sum` accept two arguments `a` and `b`.
- ✔️ Added JSDoc block for the function
- ✔️ The arguments `a` and `b` are now properly defined as parameters to the function, making it reusable and preventing
  errors.
- ✔️ Added a return statement that outputs sum of `a` and `b`
